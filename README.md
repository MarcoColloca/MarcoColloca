# Hello! I'm Marco Colloca, but my friends call me Mark. ðŸ‘‹

My journey has been quite diverse:

- **Passion for Technology**: From a young age, I have always been passionate about technology, role-playing games, and video games.
  
- **Educational Background**: My studies led me towards **Photography** and **Cinematography**.

- **Professional Experience**: For many years, I relied on the "safe harbor" of my family's small camping goods store.

---

After several years, I decided to leave that security behind and embark on a new adventure: **programming**. Thanks to the Boolean course in **Full-Stack Web Development**, I have acquired many skills in both **Front-End** and **Back-End** development. My ambition is to continue growing and expanding my knowledge to become a well-rounded web developer.
